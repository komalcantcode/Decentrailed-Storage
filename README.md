## Introduction

The Decentralized Storage System project utilizes a decentralized network of nodes to store and distribute data. It leverages blockchain technology to ensure data integrity, immutability, and availability. By distributing data across multiple nodes, it provides enhanced security and eliminates the risk of data loss or unauthorized access.

The project leverages decentralized storage using the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), creating an alternative to platforms like Google Drive. However, it goes a step further by incorporating blockchain technology to enhance data security. By utilizing IPFS, the project ensures that files are distributed across a network of nodes.

## Features

- **Decentralized Storage**: Data is stored across multiple nodes in a decentralized network, ensuring redundancy and availability.
- **Data Encryption**: Data is encrypted before being stored, providing an additional layer of security.
- **Data Integrity**: Blockchain technology guarantees the integrity and immutability of stored data.
- **Data Replication**: Data is replicated across multiple nodes, preventing data loss and improving reliability.
- **Data Retrieval**: Users can easily retrieve their stored data using a secure and efficient retrieval mechanism.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
  ```
   git clone https://github.com/Atharv181/Decentralized-Storage-System.git
  ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
  ```
   cd Decentralized-Storage-System
   npm install
  ```
3. Enter into the client(Frontend Folder):
  ```
  cd client
  ```
4. Start the decentralized storage system:
 ```
 npm run start
 ```
   
   The app will start on localhost:3000 :)
   
## Notes

1. Use mumbai network otherwise it will give you an error. 
2. If you are not able to view the images even after you upload, It may occur because of IPFS issues please try again after sometime. Or please pause the adBlocker on the site.
3. You can share your images with another address using the share button. This will share all your images uploaded.
4. If you want to view the images of shared account you type the address of that account and hit display images if you have access of that account you will be able to view it :)
